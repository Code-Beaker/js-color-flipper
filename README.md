# Simple Color Flipper App

This is basic color flipper app using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I made it with the help of [Tech With Tim](https://youtube.com/@TechWithTim) from **YouTube**.

## My experience

I'm a person who has always tried to learn Javascript and never got the spirit to continue learning because I thought the concepts were too complicated to me.

This time, I had a lot of fun building this one out. Since I'm a bit experienced with HTML and CSS, I have given the styling by myself.

### What I found interesting

I was surprised myself about how things could be done using Javascript.

**Especially this block of code to generate a random number:**

I never actually thought about using the `Math` function for this kind of purpose. This has tought me a lot!
